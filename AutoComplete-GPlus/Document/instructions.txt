Currently we use the Autocomplete v.1.4.2 which I modified greatly to suit our functionality.
However, there is a new autocomplete version out, v.1.6

The version 1.6 allows to clear autocomplete fields programmatically. The older version's tokenInput class is too closed and did not have any functions to manipulate it from the outside.

We would like to migrate to version 1.6 from version 1.4.2. However, because our current implementation is a heavily customized version of 1.4.2, we cannot just replace 1.4.2 with 1.6.

1. Can you please incorporate my additions to version 1.4.2 into version 1.6?
2. Can you please add an ability to create new tokens without having to select them from the list? If the item typed in autocomplete does not exist in the results list, when user presses comma, tab, or enter key, a new token with id of '0' should be created. Use the allowInsert attribute as a check to allow inserts of new items not from the reuslts list.
3. Make sure that if singleTokenOnly is set to true, do not allow user to add another token. If user selects a something from a list, then that selection should ovewrite the existing token.

below is the list of existing attriibutes (including ones that i have created). For existing attributes, refer to the jtokenizer documentation
